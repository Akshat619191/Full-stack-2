Learning Outcomes:
Understand the concept of state management in React applications.

Implement local state using React hooks and analyze its scope and limitations.

Share data across components using React Context API.

Implement global state management using Redux Toolkit.

Differentiate between Local State, Context API, and Redux based on use cases.

Manage application state in a centralized and predictable manner using Redux.

Use React Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) effectively.

Build modular and reusable components following React best practices.

Debug and resolve common issues related to state management.

Understand how scalable React applications handle complex state logic.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
