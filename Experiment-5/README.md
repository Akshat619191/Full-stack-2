Learning Outcomes : 

Understand the concept of Single Page Applications (SPA) and how routing works in React.

Implement Lazy Loading using React.lazy() to dynamically import components.

Use Suspense to display fallback content while lazy components are loading.

Analyze how lazy loading helps in reducing initial bundle size and improving application performance.

Integrate React Router DOM for navigation between multiple components.

Develop modular React components such as Home, About, and Contact pages.

Apply basic CSS styling to enhance the user interface of an SPA.

Build and optimize a React project using Vite build tools.

Deploy the production build (dist folder) on hosting platforms like Netlify.

Understand real-world use cases of lazy loading in large-scale web applications.# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
